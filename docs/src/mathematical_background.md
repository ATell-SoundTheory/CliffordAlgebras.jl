# Mathematical Background

This section provides the mathematical foundations for understanding Clifford algebras and their implementation in CliffordAlgebras.jl.

## What is a Clifford Algebra?

A Clifford algebra, also known as a geometric algebra, is an associative algebra that extends the concept of complex numbers to higher dimensions while preserving the geometric interpretation of multiplication.

### Formal Definition

Given a vector space V over the real numbers ℝ with a symmetric bilinear form Q (quadratic form), the Clifford algebra Cl(V,Q) is the quotient of the tensor algebra T(V) by the two-sided ideal I generated by elements of the form:

```
v ⊗ v - Q(v,v) · 1
```

for all v ∈ V.

### Signature Notation

A Clifford algebra is often denoted by its signature (p,q,r) where:
- p = number of basis vectors that square to +1
- q = number of basis vectors that square to -1  
- r = number of basis vectors that square to 0

The total dimension of the underlying vector space is n = p + q + r.

## The Clifford Relation

The fundamental relation in a Clifford algebra is:

```
eᵢeⱼ + eⱼeᵢ = 2ηᵢⱼ
```

where ηᵢⱼ is the metric tensor. For orthonormal basis vectors:
- eᵢ² = +1 if i ≤ p (positive signature)
- eᵢ² = -1 if p < i ≤ p+q (negative signature)
- eᵢ² = 0 if i > p+q (null signature)

## Multivectors and Grades

### Grade Structure

A general element (multivector) in Cl(p,q,r) can be decomposed by grade:

```
M = M₀ + M₁ + M₂ + ... + Mₙ
```

where Mₖ contains only k-vectors (elements of grade k).

- **Grade 0**: Scalars
- **Grade 1**: Vectors  
- **Grade 2**: Bivectors (oriented areas)
- **Grade 3**: Trivectors (oriented volumes)
- **Grade n**: Pseudoscalars

### Basis Elements

For an n-dimensional space, there are 2ⁿ basis elements:
- 1 scalar: 1
- (n choose 1) vectors: eᵢ
- (n choose 2) bivectors: eᵢeⱼ (i < j)
- ...
- 1 pseudoscalar: e₁e₂...eₙ

### Example: Cl(2,0,0)

In 2D Euclidean space:
- Basis: {1, e₁, e₂, e₁e₂}
- Relations: e₁² = e₂² = 1, e₁e₂ = -e₂e₁

## Products in Clifford Algebra

### Geometric Product

The geometric product is the fundamental operation, combining the inner and outer products:

```
ab = a·b + a∧b
```

Properties:
- Associative: (ab)c = a(bc)
- Distributive: a(b+c) = ab + ac
- Generally non-commutative

### Exterior Product (Wedge Product)

The exterior product a∧b creates higher-grade elements:

```
a∧b = ½(ab - ba)
```

Properties:
- Anti-commutative: a∧b = -b∧a
- Associative: (a∧b)∧c = a∧(b∧c)
- a∧a = 0

### Interior Product (Contraction)

Several types of contraction exist:

#### Left Contraction (⨼)
```
a⨼b = Σₖ ⟨ab⟩ₖ₋ᵢ where a has grade i
```

#### Right Contraction (⨽)  
```
a⨽b = Σₖ ⟨ab⟩ⱼ₋ₖ where b has grade j
```

#### Fat Dot Product (⋅)
```
a⋅b = Σₖ ⟨ab⟩|ᵢ₋ⱼ| 
```

#### Scalar Product (⋆)
```
a⋆b = ⟨ab⟩₀ (grade 0 part only)
```

## Involutions and Operations

### Grade Involution
```
α̃ = Σₖ (-1)ᵏ ⟨α⟩ₖ
```

### Reverse (Reversion)
```
α† = Σₖ (-1)^(k(k-1)/2) ⟨α⟩ₖ
```

### Clifford Conjugation
```
α̅ = Σₖ (-1)^(k(k+1)/2) ⟨α⟩ₖ
```

### Duality
The Hodge dual with respect to the pseudoscalar I:
```
*α = αI⁻¹
```

## Exponential and Logarithm

### Exponential of Bivectors

For a bivector B, the exponential gives:
```
e^B = cos(|B|) + (B/|B|)sin(|B|)
```

This formula generates rotations (for positive signature) or hyperbolic rotations (for mixed signature).

### Rotor Representation

A rotor R = e^(B/2) represents a rotation by angle |B| in the plane defined by B. The rotation is applied via:
```
v' = RvR†
```

## Common Clifford Algebras

### Cl(2,0,0) - 2D Euclidean

### Cl(3,0,0) - 3D Euclidean  
- Standard 3D vector algebra with cross product
- Quaternions live in the even subalgebra

### Cl(1,3,0) - Spacetime Algebra
- Used in relativistic physics
- Signature matches Minkowski spacetime

### Cl(3,0,1) - Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA)
- Ideal for computer graphics and robotics
- Includes points at infinity naturally

### Cl(4,1,0) - Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA)
- Unified treatment of Euclidean geometry
- Circles, spheres, and transformations

## Implementation Notes

### Sparse Representation

CliffordAlgebras.jl uses sparse representation, storing only non-zero coefficients. This is crucial for efficiency in high-dimensional algebras where most coefficients are typically zero.

### Generated Functions

The package uses `@generated` functions to create specialized code for each algebra type at compile time, ensuring optimal performance.

### Type Stability

Most operations maintain type stability, meaning the return type can be inferred at compile time, leading to efficient machine code generation.
